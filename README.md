## 🧠 Overview

The **Recipe Book App** is a web application that allows users to create, explore, and manage recipes in a personalized and interactive environment. Authenticated users can add, edit, and delete their own recipes, like recipes from other users (but not their own or the same one twice), and filter recipes by cuisine type. The app features a clean UI with light/dark mode switching for a seamless user experience.

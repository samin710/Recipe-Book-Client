## 🧠 Overview

The ***Recipe Book App*** is a dynamic web application that allows users to share and explore recipes with a range of interactive features. Users can create an account and log in to add, edit, or delete their own recipes, as well as view a personal list of their submissions. The app supports liking functionality, ensuring users can like any number of recipes—except their own or the same recipe more than once. A search feature enables filtering recipes by cuisine type, making discovery easier. Additionally, the interface includes a theme toggle for switching between dark and light modes, offering a personalized user experience.
